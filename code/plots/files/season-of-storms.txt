Geralt of Rivia fights a dangerous monster whose only goal in life is to kill people. Shortly afterwards, he is arrested, resulting in the loss of two of his priceless witcher swords. With a little help from his friend Dandelion and his connections, he does everything he can to regain his work tools. In the meantime, he gets into an affair with the sorceress Lytta Neyd (nicknamed Coral), meets influential people, and the social margin associated with the country where he lost his swords - Kerack. Geralt soon gets dragged into two dangerous conspiracies (one involving a group of sorcerers, and another involving King Belohun and his bitter sons). These events and the undisguised and reciprocated reluctance of the magicians towards Geralt (who turn out to be related to this story) make the whole thing a series of failures, during which the hero is forced to make difficult decisions.

The epilogue of the book is set years after The Witcher Saga.
