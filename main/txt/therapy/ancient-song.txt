Nearly 6,000 years ago, a musical instrument was created in Peru. It's a type of flute, often called a pan flute. It is one of the oldest known instruments in the world. Sometimes it is called a panpipe. China, Japan, Egypt, and many other countries also have their own versions of the flute.

The pan flute is named after a Greek god named Pan. He was the god of shepherds and of nature.

The flute is made of small pipes or tubes that are all tied in a row. It is played by blowing over the open holes in one end. In the past, pipes were made from bamboo, cane, and reeds. Today they are often made of wood, plastic, or metal.

The pan flute is still being played all around the modern world.
