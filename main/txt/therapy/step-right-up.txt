Many of us enjoyed a trip to the circus as children. The term "big top" refers to the main tent in the center of a circus.

The word "circus" comes from a Latin word that means circus or ring. The first type of circus appeared in ancient Rome. Viewers came to watch people juggle and perform stunts. They also came to see wild animals.

The very first modern circus appeared in London. It was the year 1768. A man named Philip Astley gets the credit. He rode a horse around in a circle and did stunts.

Much has changed since the first circus tent was raised. People from all walks of life come to laugh at the clowns. Acrobats thrill us with amazing stunts. Trapeze artists fly through the air.

The circus is a fun time for people of all ages.
