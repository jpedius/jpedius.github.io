Flying from New York to London? Most flights last seven hours. Are you in a big hurry? Get ready to shell out the dough.

The Concorde used to be the fastest passenger plane in the sky. This aircraft began commercial service in 1976. It could fly across the Atlantic Ocean in less than 3<<period>>5 hours. Tickets cost thousands of dollars.

All Concorde flights were grounded in 2003. This was due to high operating costs and low tickets sales.

Still want to go there fast? There is another option. The Cessna Citation X is the world's fastest private jet. This plane will set you back a cool $23 million. It can take you from New York to London in four hours. The Citation X wins the prize for cost as well as speed.
