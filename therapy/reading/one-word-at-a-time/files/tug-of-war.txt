Athletes show their skill at the Olympic Games every four years. Did you know that the games used to include a tug of war?

Tug of war was part of the ancient games held in 500 BC. The event was added to the modern Olympics from 1900 to 1920. It was part of the track and field program.

A tug of war event was between two teams. Eight people were on each team. Each round lasted just five minutes. One team had to push the other team six feet along in order to win.

Strength and skill are needed to win this event. Perhaps a tug of war event should be brought back to the Olympic Games?
