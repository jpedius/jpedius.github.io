One afternoon, Grandma Jane was reading in her cabin in the woods. Her grandson was asleep in his cot across the room. A breeze came through the open door.

Grandma Jane lowered her book as she heard a rustling noise outside. A young bear appeared at the door. He walked in slowly towards the baby's cot. Grandma Jane was both stunned and scared. But this was not her first encounter with a young bear. She knew what to do. She stood up on her chair to look bigger. Suddenly, she ROARED!

The young bear was so surprised that he ran back into the woods. Although Grandma Jane's heart was racing, she smiled as she climbed down from the chair. She walked over to her grandson's cot. He was now awake and smiling. She picked him up, gave him a kiss, and stopped to close the front door on her way back to her seat.
